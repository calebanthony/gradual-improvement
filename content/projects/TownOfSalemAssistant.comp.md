##### A helper tool for keeping track of roles in Town of Salem ranked mode.

[Town of Salem](http://www.blankmediagames.com/) is a hidden-role game where players are split into teams and try to discover who's with them and who's against them.

The tricky part of the game is that players can (and will) lie.

This tool helps to keep track of the claims that players make as well as what roles are available in a ranked game to help narrow down who is on your team and who wants you dead.

### How To Use
* In a game, keep track of roles and claims using the far left column.
* When a player is eliminated, click on the row to grey it out. This helps keep track of what roles are left.
* Use the center column to know how to bluff so that the Investigator role won't know who you are.
* Use the far right column to know what roles are possible in the game to keep track if a player is lying or not.

### Technology
* This was an initial project for me with Vue. I forked the project from someone doing something similar, then did a re-write to understand how the pieces all work together.
