##### A fan-site for the arena shooter [Gigantic](https://www.gogigantic.com/en/)

### Features
* Create and share [builds](https://sanctumfalls.com/builds) for the game's heroes.
 * Each hero has a unique set of branching skills that not only make each hero play differently, but also provides a wide variety of build paths to make each game unique.
* Create and share [guides](https://sanctumfalls.com/guides/HK-206) for the game's heroes.
 * Where a build is just a skill build path, a guide is a full-fledged tour of a hero's specific build path. This allows the user to lay out pros and cons for their specific build as well as explain their choices with a text area.
* Vote on how powerful you think a hero is with the user-voted [tier list](https://sanctumfalls.com/tierlist).
 * Heroes can change in power as the game gets updates, so I created a way for the community to vote heroes into specific tiers so you can see how powerful certain heroes are at a glance.

### Technology Stack
* I used Laravel for this entire project. Auth, Models, Database, API, and even the front-end were written using the tools Laravel provides.
